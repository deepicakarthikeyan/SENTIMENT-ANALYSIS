Task Description: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

The goal of this task is to perform sentiment analysis on textual data, such as customer reviews or social media posts, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis is used to identify and classify the emotional tone of text as positive, negative, or neutral, helping organizations understand user opinions and feedback.

In this task, a dataset containing text data is loaded into a Jupyter Notebook. The data is first cleaned and preprocessed to improve model performance. Preprocessing steps include converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, eliminating stop words, and tokenizing the text. These steps help reduce noise and prepare the data for feature extraction.

After preprocessing, the text is transformed into numerical representations using techniques such as Bag of Words or TF-IDF vectorization. These methods convert textual information into feature vectors that can be processed by machine learning models.

A machine learning model such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machine is then implemented to classify the sentiment of the text. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.

Model evaluation is carried out using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are analyzed to gain insights into sentiment patterns present in the dataset.

The final deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook that showcases data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation results, and insights. This task demonstrates practical application of NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and highlights their importance in analyzing large volumes of textual data.
